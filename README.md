# SEAL Dota Season 1 Rules

## How it works

This is separate from rules - rules are intended to be boring and take care of the details - not everyone’s going to read all of the rules. How it works should be something everyone does read and should be easy to understand.

### 1. How Teams Form

* Prior to the season, individuals sign up as a captain, player, free agent, or standin - this is not a league for pre-made teams.
* All signups must be vouched by an admin for conduct and activity.
* Captains select 5 other players for their team in a player draft on (X-7 date) outlined here:
		* Captains are seeded into a preliminary draft order roughly based on MMR (Lowest to highest).
		* After each round, the draft order is revised - the average MMR of the team drafted up to that point is used (lowest to highest).
* During the season, free agents may be added to teams that lose players.

### 2. Regular Season

* The regular season will be 8 weeks long (X date through Y date), with a captain’s mode bo2 each week
* Games are to begin by 8pm Pacific Time each Sunday
* They may be played earlier if both captains agree
* Teams will be matched against other teams that have a similar record

### 3. Post Season

* Teams will be seeded (based on regular season play) into 4 team bo3 brackets for 1st, 5th, 9th, etc
* There will be two weeks of play for each team
* For example, the two teams that lose first round in the 1st place bracket will play for 3rd place

## Rules

### 1. Eligibility

* Participants must sign up with their main account and it cannot be shared
* Participants must alert the admins if their MMR may not accurately reflect their skill level
* Accounts must have at least 10 dota games (excluding Ability Draft) between X date and Y date shown on Dotabuff
* For Season 1, all participants must be vouched by an admin for activity and behavior
	* Nobody should expect to miss more than 3 weeks in the season (including playoffs)
		1. If players expect inconsistent attendance for an upcoming season, they are encouraged to instead sign up as a standin or free agent, as appropriate.
		2. Nobody should be more cancerous than Aeosynth (he is the floor)

### 2. Participation

* Every player on a team’s roster must play in at least 1 game of the bo2 each week if available

### 3. Player Trades

* With approval from both captains, both players?, and the admins, players may be traded between teams any week Monday - Thursday

### 4. Games

* All games are to be played on the USW server and in Captains Mode, hosted by one of the captains on the SEAL ticket
* Games must start on time - below are the penalties for being late:
	* 8:05pm or later - Level 1 draft penalty
	* 8:10pm or later - Level 2 draft penalty
	* 8:15pm or later - Level 3 draft penalty
	* 8:20pm or later - Forfeit both games
* Each team is allowed 10 minutes of pause time per game
* All chat is allowed, unless either captain requests no all chat
	* All chat is still allowed for purposes of calling real GG
* The “Away” team (listed second in the matchups) has choice of side or pick in game 1 and the “Home” team has choice of side or pick in game 2
* Teams are not allowed to “stream cheat” in any way - no player currently in a game may view a stream of the game, spectate the game, or communicate with anyone doing so
* Team members not playing are permitted in the coach slot, but are not allowed to ping or communicate with the team in any way

### 5. Standins

* Standins may only be used if no players are available from the team’s regular 6 man roster or if all players in the lobby agree.
* Standins must be approved by the opposing team’s captain unless:
	* The standin’s MMR on the draft sheet is < 3k
	* The standin’s draft position is 1 full round below the lowest-drafted player missing
	* The standin’s MMR on the draft sheet is 500 below the lowest-MMR player missing

### 6. Free Agents

* Free agents may be assigned by the admins with the following priority (assuming MMR is similar to the player being replaced):
	* Players left over from the draft/signed up as free agents prior to the season
	* Players from disbanded teams that were not the cause of the disband
	* Players that signed up as free agents during the season
### 7. Conduct

* Flaming is part of DOTA2, but repeated conduct (in games, discord, subreddit, or anywhere) that violates the below standards may result in removal from the league:
	* No hate speech (speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender)
	* No cyber-bullying (for example, repeatedly telling someone to kill themselves)
	* No tactical fake GG calls (BM fake GG calls are allowed)

### 8. Postseason
* Teams will be seeded into 4-team brackets based on the following:
	* W-L record
	* Strength of schedule
	* Number of standins used (fewer is better)

### 9. Additional Circumstances
* If a majority of the admins approve, any action may be taken and will be accompanied by a subreddit post outlining the action and reasoning
